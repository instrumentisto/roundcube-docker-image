## How to use this image

To simply run Roundcube Webmail image mount your Roundcube configuration and use `apache` image version: 
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /my/roundcube.config.php:/app/config/config.inc.php \
    instrumentisto/roundcube:apache
```

It's better to do it with [Docker Compose][8]. See [Apache Docker Compose example][7] for details.

If you prefer [Nginx][10] and [PHP-FPM][9], you just require second sidecar [Nginx container][11]:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  roundcube:
    image: instrumentisto/roundcube:fpm
    expose:
      - "9000"
    volumes:
      - app-volume:/app
      - ./roundcube.config.php:/app/config/config.inc.php:ro
  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable-alpine
    depends_on:
      - roundcube
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - app-volume:/var/www
      - ./nginx.vh.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
volumes:
  app-volume:
```

See [Nginx and PHP-FPM Docker Compose example][6] for details.

Also, this image contains prepared directory for SQLite database (if you choose to use one) in `/var/db/` path. So your `db_dsnw` parameter is preferred to have following value:
```php
$config['db_dsnw'] = 'sqlite:////var/db/roundcube.db?mode=0640';
```

Check out [examples][13] for more details.




## Environment Variables


### `PHP_OPCACHE_REVALIDATION`

The image contains [PHP OPcache][4] enabled. By default, cache revalidation is disabled for performance purposes, so once PHP script runs - it is cached forever and no changes to it have effect.

To disable this behavior, specify `PHP_OPCACHE_REVALIDATION=1` environment variable on container start. This will turn on OPcache revalidation, so any changes to PHP scripts will have desired effect. In this case it's also recommended disabling [PHP OPcache JIT][14], as described below.


### `PHP_OPCACHE_JIT_BUFFER_SIZE` (>= 1.5 only)

By default, the image contains `tracing` [PHP OPcache JIT][14] enabled of `100M` buffer size, for performance purposes.

To disable this behavior, specify `PHP_OPCACHE_JIT_BUFFER_SIZE=0` environment variable on container start. This will turn off [OPcache JIT][14] completely.


### `SHARE_APP`

There are some container environments (like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)) where you can't share directory from one container to another directly. Instead, you should create a volume, place there desired files and mount this volume to both containers.

With providing `SHARE_APP=1` environment variable you have this behavior out-of-the-box. It will copy all the Roundcube Webmail sources from `/app/` directory to `/shared/` directory (just mount your volume to this directory) on container start and serve them from there. See [Kubernetes example][5] for details.




## Image tags


### `apache`, `latest`

The image with Roundcube Webmail served by [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org). 


### `fpm`

The image with Roundcube Webmail served by [PHP-FPM][9].  
It cannot be used alone and is intended to be used in conjunction with some other web server image (like [Nginx][11], [Apache][12], etc).

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project][1], available in [the alpine official image][2]. [Alpine Linux][1] is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.


### `<X>`

Latest tag of the latest major `X` Roundcube Webmail version.


### `<X.Y>`

Latest tag of the latest minor `X.Y` Roundcube Webmail version.


### `<X.Y.Z>`

Latest tag of the concrete `X.Y.Z` Roundcube Webmail version.


### `<X.Y.Z>-r<N>`

Concrete `N` image revision tag of the concrete `X.Y.Z` Roundcube Webmail version.

Once built, it's never updated.
